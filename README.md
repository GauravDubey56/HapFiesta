## Inspiration :sparkles:
We've been attending hackathons and other tech events for quite a time now. We've observed mishaps during event hosting and faults while registering and receiving updates.:speech_balloon:

 Having gone through such difficulties ourselves, missing out on important mini-events, we came up with an innovative idea to resolve this setback, using *HapFiesta*:exclamation::exclamation:


## What it does :muscle:
Once logging in to HapFiesta, users with admin rights can create/host events and set their schedule and event details. Various mini-events can be included by the host.:confetti_ball:

Further, users can register into events after authenticating with Google sign up. They can register into each sub-event and get updates via mail.:email:

In addition, The attendance feature of the application can be used to mark attendance to the events that a user has registered to. Hence, HapFiesta helps to bridge the gap between event managers and participants.:bridge_at_night:


## How we built it :construction_worker:
HapFiesta is a web application built using ReactJS for the frontend :arrow_forward: and MongoDB and ExpressJS for the backend :arrow_backward:. JSON Web Token has been used to implement the authentication process. Postman was used to performing the attendance feature using routes and tests.

VSCode has been used as the primary IDE. With the combination of various programming languages including JavaScript and multiple APIs to set up the framework of the application, we have successfully created a working model of HapFiesta.:computer:


## Challenges we ran into :construction:
While creating the core structure of the application, we had to design the integration of the backend and frontend aspects. We faced quite a lot of difficulties in the creation of the backend structure. 

The idea behind the application needs multiple models to execute. Creating each model with precise entities and setting up routes took many efforts and dedication to accomplish.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of :checkered_flag:
After all the efforts and teamwork, we were finally able to build a working model of our web application. We set up the structural foundation of our backend and were able to execute it on time.

During the length of this hackathon, we have worked majorly on the backend portion of our application and created a minimalistic frontend. HapFiesta has smooth functioning and easy-to-implement functions.


## What we learned :white_check_mark:
While participatng, we've acquired knowledge of full-stack web development. We've learned to implement features and integrate the entire project and its functionalities. 

We've learned to work together as a team and dedicate our time and energy towards a single cause. :busts_in_silhouette:


## What's next for HapFiesta :sunny::cherry_blossom:
For future prospects, we're looking forward to create a full-fledged frontend for the web application. Certain functions need to be added to the application. :gem:

We are aiming to create a website for HapFiesta and popularize it even further. The application would be well suited to bridge the gap between participants and technology.
